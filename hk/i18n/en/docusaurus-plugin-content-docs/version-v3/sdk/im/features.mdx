With Instant Messaging, you can easily implement the commonly-used messaging features for socializing, live streaming, customer support, and online games.

## Features

Below are the main features provided by the Instant Messaging service:

### Basic Features

Add one-on-one chats, group chats, chat rooms, and system conversations into your app and allow users to send text messages, voice messages, videos, and locations. You can even create your own message types.

### Authorization and Signing

You can enable the third-party signing mechanism to verify the requests from the clients and ensure the data in your app is always secure.

### Single-Device Sign-on and Push Notifications

Decide whether a user can log in on multiple devices or just a single device at a time. Set up push notifications to get offline users notified of new messages.

### Message Hooks

Set up hooks on different stages of a message or conversation to extend our features.

### Mentioning People, Recalling Messages, and Editing Messages

Users can mention other people in a message. They can also recall or edit the messages they sent out. Messages can be cached on the local device for faster retrieval.
