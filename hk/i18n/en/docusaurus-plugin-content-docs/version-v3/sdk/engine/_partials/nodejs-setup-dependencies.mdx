Cloud Engine will automatically install dependencies according to the `package.json` in your project:

```json title='package.json'
{
  "dependencies": {
    "leancloud-storage": "^3.11.0",
    "leanengine": "^3.3.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^1.18.7"
  }
}
```

While installing dependencies, Cloud Engine will trigger the [life cycle scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scripts#life-cycle-scripts) of npm, such as `postinstall` and `prepare`.

Since Cloud Engine installs dependencies on the server side, the CLI won’t upload `node_modules` by default. If you’re deploying with Git, you should include `node_modules` in `.gitignore` so it won’t be tracked by Git.

:::note
CLI will upload `.yarn` directory, if you don't want to enable [Zero-installs](https://yarnpkg.com/features/caching#zero-installs) when Yarn 2+ [PnP\(Plug'n'Play\)](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) is used, add `.yarn/cache` to your `.gitignore` and `.leanignore`
