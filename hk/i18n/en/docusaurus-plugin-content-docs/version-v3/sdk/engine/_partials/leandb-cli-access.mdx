You can open an interactive shell connected to LeanDB using <Command suffix=" db shell" />, a command provided by the [CLI](/v3/sdk/engine/cli):

<CodeBlock>
  {`$ ${CLI_BINARY} db shell mysqldb
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.
Your MySQL connection id is 3450564
Type 'help;' or '\\h' for help. Type '\\c' to clear the current input statement.
mysql> use test
Database changed
mysql> insert into users set name = 'leancloud';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.04 sec)
mysql> select * from users;
+------+-----------+
| id   | name      |
+------+-----------+
|    1 | zhenzhen  |
|    2 | leancloud |
+------+-----------+
2 rows in set (0.06 sec)`}
</CodeBlock>

With <Command suffix=" db proxy" />, you can export LeanDB to a local port and have local programs or GUI clients connect to the database:

<CodeBlock>
  {`$ ${CLI_BINARY} db proxy myredis
[INFO] Now, you can connect myredis via [redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -a hsdt9wIAuKcTZmpg -p 5678]`}
</CodeBlock>

As long as you keep the terminal open, you’ll be able to access LeanDB from the port 5678. You can use a GUI client to browse and interact with LeanDB. While running your project with <Command suffix=" up" />, you can also have your program connected to LeanDB using this feature. You can set the environment variable (from the output of <Command suffix=" db proxy" />):

```shell
export REDIS_URL_myredis=redis://default:hsdt9wIAuKcTZmpg@127.0.0.1:5678
```

:::note

You should only use <Command suffix=" db" /> for developing and debugging locally. Don’t use it for the production environment, as the connection might be interrupted occasionally.
