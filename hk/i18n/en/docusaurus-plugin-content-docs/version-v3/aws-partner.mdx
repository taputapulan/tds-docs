TapTap—China's active mobile game community—has officially become Amazon's software partner. The two parties will aggregate each other's technology and publishing capabilities, starting from 0, to help developers going overseas to solve the problem of early going overseas, reduce developers costs, and provide overseas games more comprehensive support.

TapTap is a zero-commission app store that lets gamers download gaming applications onto Android mobile phone while content providers are able to take 100% revenue. Meanwhile, TapTap has a robust community of developers and gamers that safely use the application. Since TapTap includes a community of developers that can add their apps to the platform, multiple versions of the same game can be found like TapTap PUBG.

TapTap is trying to remodel the 30% revenue cut taken by Apple’s App Store and Google Play — announcing a 0% revenue share with game developers. After two years of exploration and development, TapTap International has users in more than 170 countries (regions). In April this year, the new version of TapTap International was launched, serving overseas players with a new look and exciting functions. TapTap Developer Service (TDS) is also gradually opening more functions in the international version to provide support for overseas developers and domestic overseas manufacturers.

Up to now, a number of games such as "Sausage Man" and "Flash Party" have completed the whole process of publishing, testing and launching through the TapTap international version. In addition, TapTap's unique community system also brings novel and effective operation methods for the game's overseas platform distribution. TapTap International's "Sausage Man" launched in July 2021. Its game forum has gathered more than 1.4 million players and published nearly 3,000 discussion posts. Developers hold various activities in the community to enhance user stickiness and retention.

Benefiting from TapTap's zero-commission business model, well-known game developers such as Epic Games have also partnered with TapTap. The worldwide popular Fortnite is now officially exclusive to TapTap, offering download, installation and forum services. Currently, Fortnite has recorded over 10 million downloads on TapTap.

According to XD’s financial report in 2021, the MAU of the TapTap international version has grown to 12.24 million, and it still maintains a high growth rate. Based on tens of millions of MAUs, in addition to the basic distribution capabilities, TapTap has the ability to provide more platform-based one-stop services for domestic developers going overseas. For example, "bonfire testing" or "beta testing" can help developers acquire seed users and provide a sufficient and diverse population for each level of testing. Users help developers tune the game through the mechanism of community feedback and grow in testing. For global testing, developers generally cannot easily open Google and iOS stores in key countries such as the United States, Germany and France during the testing period. Only some small-volume countries such as the Philippines, Canada, etc. can be opened for testing. With the help of TapTap, we can introduce more users from core countries, especially users in Tier-1 countries. The number of users in TapTap international is quite stable, which help developer solve the problem of user volume during the test period. In global testing process, advertising purchases are often limited by the insufficient cold start speed and the small purchase area. It is difficult to import sufficient number of users on the test day or the next day.
