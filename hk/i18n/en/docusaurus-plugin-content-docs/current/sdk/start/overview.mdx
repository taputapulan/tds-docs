TapTap Developer Services (TDS) empowers game developers with a collection of tools that helps them develop, operate, and maintain quality games more efficiently than ever. Our vision is to promote a positive environment within the game industry for both developers and players.

TDS provides the following services that you can use by integrating TapSDK in your games:

- **[TapTap Login](/sdk/taptap-login/features/)**: Allows players to quickly log into the game by authorizing with a TapTap account.

- **[TapTap IAP](/sdk/TapPayments/overview/)**: Provides a secure and convenient in-app purchase experience for players.


To use the corresponding services, complete <Conditional region="cn">[Developer Registration](https://developer.taptap.cn/)</Conditional><Conditional region="global">[Developer Registration](https://developer.taptap.io/)</Conditional>, log into the Developer Center, and “Turn on” Game Services.
