To use TapTap Developer Services (TDS Services), you need to complete the initial configuration work.

## Create an Application

Before using TDS services, you need to create an application to complete the preparatory work for integration. Refer to the [Store Guide](/store/) for creating an application.

## Enable Application Configuration

Go to **TapTap Developer Center > Your Game > Game Services > Application Configuration**, click "Enable Now" to obtain the basic information of the current application.

### Basic Information

`Client ID` is a unique identifier for an application entity package in the TapTap Developer Center. TapTap uses `Client ID` to authenticate the application's identity. Each application can only have one `Client ID`. If the same application distinguishes between test and official servers, two different applications need to be created, each with its own application configuration enabled.

### Applicable Regions

<Conditional region="cn">

A client can only correspond to one region. This is because, within TapTap's account system, users in Mainland China and users worldwide are isolated and distinct from each other.

</Conditional>

<Conditional region="global">

Applicable to countries and regions outside of Mainland China.

## Privacy Statement

To integrate account services, you must first sign the [TapTap Platform Developer Agreement](/store/store-devagreement/). Using TDS services is considered as your agreement to all the aforementioned agreements, and you will bear the corresponding legal responsibilities and obligations based on these agreements.

## Configure Signature Certificate

For higher security, TapTap login service requires verification of your game. You need to submit the game's package name (Android package name), Bundle ID (iOS package name), and Android signature.

:::tip

1. The Android package name should follow the naming conventions of Android. Reference documentation: [Android Developers - Set the Application ID](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id)

2. The Android signature is the MD5 string (32-bit) from the Keystore file. Please remove special symbols when entering it.

3. The iOS Bundle ID should follow Apple's naming conventions. Reference documentation: [Property List Key - CFBundle Identifier](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleidentifier)
