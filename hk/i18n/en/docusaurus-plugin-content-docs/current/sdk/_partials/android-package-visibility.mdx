Android 11 (API level 30) has ramped up its privacy protection policies resulting in a series of changes and restrictions, one of the key changes being [Package Visibility](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/package-visibility), which prevents third-party apps from launching the TapTap app. This has affected related TapTap services from functioning properly, including but not limited to accessing TapTap for updates and purchase verification.

**Solution 1**

Compile the game with `targetSdkVersion` set to 29 (setting this to 30 or above will lead to the problem).

**Solution 2**

1. Change gradle build tools to 4.1.0+:

   ```java
   classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.0'
   ```

2. Add the following lines to AndroidManifest.xml:

   ```xml
   <queries>
       <package android:name="com.taptap" />
       <package android:name="com.taptap.pad" />
       <package android:name="com.taptap.global" />
   </queries>
   ```
