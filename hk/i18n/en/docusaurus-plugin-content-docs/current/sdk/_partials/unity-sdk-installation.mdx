### External Dependency Integration

The SDK internally uses some third-party libraries. Developers need to ensure that the external dependencies are properly integrated before using the SDK. The specific settings are as follows:

1. The SDK uses the `Newtonsoft-json` library for JSON parsing. If this dependency is already integrated in the current project, no additional handling is needed. Otherwise, add the following dependency to `Packages/manifest.json`:

```json
"com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json":"3.2.1"
```

2. The SDK uses `com.google.external-dependency-manager` to manage Android and iOS dependencies. If this dependency is already integrated in the current project, no additional handling is needed. Otherwise, add the following dependency to `Packages/manifest.json`:

```json
{
   "dependencies": {
      "com.google.external-dependency-manager": "1.2.179"
   },
   "scopedRegistries": [
      {
         "name": "package.openupm.com",
         "url": "https://package.openupm.com",
         "scopes": [
            "com.google.external-dependency-manager"
         ]
      }
  ]
}
```

:::tip

If you need to integrate TapSDK for the Unity PC platform, you need to use the NuGet integration tool to integrate the `K4os.Compression.LZ4` and `protobuf-net` libraries. The specific settings are as follows:

- Add the following dependency in `Packages/manifest.json`:
```json
"com.github-glitchenzo.nugetforunity": "https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity.git?path=/src/NuGetForUnity"
```
- After adding, if the **NuGet** option does not appear in the top menu of Unity, restart the Unity editor, including the Unity Hub client.
- In the top menu of Unity, select **NuGet > Manage NuGet Packages**, search for `K4os.Compression.LZ4` and `protobuf-net` in the pop-up window, and install them.

  The final `packages.config` file in the Assets folder will automatically generate the following dependencies:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<packages>
  <package id="K4os.Compression.LZ4" version="1.3.8" manuallyInstalled="true" />
  <package id="System.Collections.Immutable" version="7.0.0" />
  <package id="System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe" version="6.0.0" />
  <package id="protobuf-net" version="3.2.30" manuallyInstalled="true" />
  <package id="protobuf-net.Core" version="3.2.30" />
</packages>
```

### Adding SDK Dependencies

The SDK supports integration through **Unity Package Manager** and local file imports. Developers can choose one of these methods based on their needs, with remote dependencies being recommended.

#### Remote Dependency

The SDK can be integrated via NPMJS or GitHub. Developers can choose one of these methods.

##### 1. NPMJS Integration

Add the following dependencies in the project's `Packages/manifest.json` file:

<CodeBlock language="json">
  {`"dependencies":{
    ${props.npmDeps.map(dep => `"${dep}":"${v4SDKVersions.taptap.unity}",`).join('\n    ')}
}`}
</CodeBlock>

Note that you need to declare `scopedRegistries` at the same level as `dependencies` in `Packages/manifest.json`:

```json
"scopedRegistries":[
  {
    "name": "NPMJS",
    "url": "https://registry.npmjs.org/",
    "scopes": ["com.taptap"]
  }
]
```

##### 2. GitHub Integration

Add the following dependencies in the project's `Packages/manifest.json` file:

<CodeBlock language="json">
 {`"dependencies":{
   ${props.githubDeps.map(dep => `"${dep.package}":"${dep.url}",`).join('\n   ')}
 }`}
</CodeBlock>

In Unity's top menu, select **Window > Package Manager** to view packages installed in the project.

#### Local File Import

1. Download the corresponding `unitypackage` files for the modules from the [Download Page](/tap-download) and import them into the Unity project through **Assets > Import Packages > Custom Packages**, including:

  <ul>
    {props.unitypackageModules.map(module => <li><code>{module.name}</code> {module.desc}ã€‚</li>)}
  </ul>

2. If the current project has already integrated the `Newtonsoft.Json` dependency, skip this step. Otherwise, download the library file from `NuGet.org` [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json) by clicking "Download package" on the right, change the file extension from `.nupkg` to `.zip`, extract the file, and copy the `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` file to the `Plugins` directory under `Assets`. Additionally, to avoid deleting necessary data when exporting to the IL2CPP platform, create a `link.xml` file in the `Assets` directory (if it already exists, add the following content):

```xml
<linker>
  <assembly fullname="System.Core">
    <type fullname="System.Linq.Expressions.Interpreter.LightLambda" preserve="all" />
  </assembly>
</linker>
```
