By integrating TapTap Payments into your game, you can sell two different types of in-game items:

- **Consumable Items:** Consumable items are those that, when used by the user, the game allocates associated game content, and the user can purchase these items repeatedly. Examples include coins, power-ups, etc.
- **Non-Consumable Items:** Non-consumable items are those that can be used permanently after a one-time purchase. Examples include paid upgrades and level packs.
