TapTap Payments is exclusively used within the TapTap Payments service to settle earnings for developers on a periodic payment schedule and transfer funds to the developer's financial account. Before receiving payments from TapTap, please ensure that you have completed the financial payment information:

1. TapTap Developer Service Center - "Finance and Management" - "Financial Entity";

2. Fill in the entity information and financial account details;

## Payment Cycle and Report

The payment cycle of TapTap is typically 45 days after the end of a calendar month. For example, the income for the calendar month of January (January 1 - January 31) will enter the accounting stage after January 31, and payment will be completed within 45 days thereafter, meaning March 15 is the latest payment date from TapTap. Please note that your bank may take a few days to credit the funds to your account.

After entering the accounting stage, you can view the settlement report under "Finance and Management" - "Reconciliation and Settlement," which includes data such as product sales amount, user refund amount, fee deductions, and actual earnings for the current billing period. You must carefully verify the report and confirm the final amount with TapTap within 7 working days.
